 <h2>Ingredients</h2>

 <ul>
    <li>8 ounces dark, semi-sweet, or bittersweet chocolate (60% cacao, preferably)</li>
    <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon powdered sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
 </ul>

 <h2>Directions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
        Chop the chocolate:
        Finely chop the chocolate into small pieces. The pieces have to be able to dissolve easily
        in the liquid. Set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        Warm the milk:
        Place the milk into a small, thick-bottomed pot on low heat and bring to a low simmer. 
        Whisk once in a while to ensure that the milk doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.


        If you wish, add herbs or spices to the milk, bring to a simmer then take off the heat and
        allow to steep for 10 minutes. Strain the liquid then place back into the pot and return to a simmer.
    </li>

    <li>
        Add the chocolate:
        Add the chocolate, vanilla, powdered sugar, and salt, and whisk vigorously until the chocolate has 
        melted
    </li>

    <li>
        Melt the chocolate:
        Heat for another 4 minutes, constantly stirring, until the chocolate is completely melted.
