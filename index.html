    <h2>Healthier Homemade Mac and Cheese</h2>
    <p>
        To make this rich mac and cheese recipe healthier we use whole wheat bread crumbs, low-fat milk and cheese, 
        whole wheat noodles, and reduced the amount of butter. Serve with a salad for a healthy meatless dinner

    <h2>Homemade Apple Pie</h2>
    <p>This is absolutely the best homemade apple pie you'll ever make! It 
        has a flaky, buttery crust and a tender, lightly-spiced apple pie filling. 
        Use a combination of apples for best flavor, and bake until the top is golden 
        and the filling is bubbly!

    <h2>Homemade Hot Chocolate</h2>
    <p>
        Homemade hot chocolate is a dreamy treat on a cold day. Skip the powdered stuff and make this recipe with real chocolate,
        whole milk, and vanilla. Top with a dollop of whipped cream.
